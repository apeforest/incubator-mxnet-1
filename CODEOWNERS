# Owners of Apache MXNet
# Please see documentation of use of CODEOWNERS file at
# https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/ and 
# https://github.com/blog/2392-introducing-code-owners
# 
# The first owner listed for a package is considered the maintainer for a package.
# Anybody can add themselves or a team (see https://help.github.com/articles/about-teams/)
# as additional owners to get notified about changes in a specific package.
#
# By default the package maintainer should merge PR after appropriate review.
# A PR which received 2 +1 (or LGTM) comments can be merged by any committer.
# In the future we might consider adopting required reviews 
# (see https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/)
